Project Idea
In our country we often see that fish farmers face different types of problems like there is no dynamic system to continuously measure water pH level, temperature, O2 and CO2 level, water level and show notification if any metrics get out of range. So our system will dynamically detect water pH level, temperature, O2 and CO2 level and compare them with standard range that is good for fish health and show notification if any metrics value is out of range. The notification is shown on a LCD monitor and a red led light will glow and piezo will start buzzing when the water is not safe for fish.

Social Impact of the Project
Our system will help the fish farmer to maintain water quality for farming fish. As our system dynamically notify fish farmers about water quality, farmers are able to produce more fish and the death rate of fish during firming will be reduced. So the overall economy of the country will be enriched.

Features
 Measure temperature of the water
 Measure pH level of the water
 Measure O2 and CO2 level of the water
 Detect water level
 Monitor fish movement
 Comparing with standard range and show notification to the user

Equipement
 1x Arduino UNO
 1x Piezo Buzzer
 1x Led light
 1x Temperature sensor
 1x pH sensor
 1x O2 sensor

Challenges
Merging multiple sensors and making them work accordingly is a bit difficult.
Need to handle multiple corner cases for different standard ranges for different water quality metrics.
