Project Idea:          
In our country we often see that fish farmers face different types of problems like there is no
dynamic system to continuously measure water pH level, temperature, O2 and CO2 level, water level
and show notification if any metrics get out of range. So our system will dynamically detect water
pH level, temperature, O2 and CO2 level and compare them with standard range that is good for fish
health and show notification if any metrics value is out of range. The notification is shown on a 
LCD monitor and a red led light will glow and piezo will start buzzing when the water is not safe for fish.



Social Impact of the Project:      
Our system will help the fish farmer to maintain water quality for farming fish. As our system dynamically
notify fish farmers about water quality, farmers are able to produce more fish and the death rate of fish
during firming will be reduced. So the overall economy of the country will be enriched.





Features
1. Measure temperature of the water
2. Measure pH level of the water
3. Measure O2 and CO2 level of the water
4. Detect water level
5. Monitor fish movement
6. Comparing with standard range and show notification to the user






Equipements
1. 1x Arduino UNO
2. 1x Piezo Buzzer
3. 1x Led light
4. 1x Temperature sensor
5. 1x pH sensor
6. 1x O2 sensor




Challenges
1. Merging multiple sensors and making them work accordingly is a bit difficult.
2. Need to handle multiple corner cases for different standard ranges for different water quality metrics.
